## C++ Development Repository
This repository contains a diverse collection of C++ projects, ranging from foundational programming concepts and mathematical simulations to advanced multithreaded systems and web services.

## Directory Structure


### Core Projects & Modules

Stock Transaction Engine:  A high-performance engine designed for processing and managing stock market transactions.

Object Tracking: A computer vision based project that tracks the movement of an object (red but changeable) using Kalman Filter. A mouse tracking version also exists in the project.

Web Server:  A C++ implementation of a functional web server for handling network requests.

Multithreading_scripts:  Advanced implementations focusing on concurrent programming and thread management.

Essential operations:  A module dedicated to core algorithms and fundamental system operations.

## Script Index


### Simulations & Logic

monty_hall.cpp: A simulation of the Monty Hall problem using arrays and random number generation to verify probability theory.

guessing_game.cpp: An interactive console-based number guessing game.

leap_year.cpp: Logic to determine if a given year is a leap year.

zellers_congruence.cpp: An implementation of Zeller's algorithm to calculate the day of the week for any date.


### Mathematics & Finance
math_is_fun.cpp: Demonstrations of various mathematical operations and functions.

basic_tax.cpp: A script for calculating basic tax obligations.

roi.cpp: Returns on Investment (ROI) calculator.

temp_converter.cpp: A utility to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.


### Data Structures & Fundamentals
array_sort.cpp: Implementation of sorting algorithms for array structures.

ToDoList.cpp: A functional console application for managing personal tasks.

struct1.cpp: Demonstrations of C++ struct usage for data grouping.

data_types.cpp: Exploration of C++ primitive data types and memory allocation.

typedef_using.cpp: Demonstrations of type aliasing using typedef and using.

ex_namespace.cpp: Examples of namespace organization and scope management.


### Testing & Utilities
exception_test.cpp: A suite for testing C++ exception handling and error robustness.

Hello world.cpp: The classic entry-level program.

copyer.py / test.py: Python-based utility scripts for file management and testing.


## Getting Started
Prerequisites
A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

Python 3.x (for utility scripts).

### Compilation
To compile a specific script, use a command similar to:

``` Bash
    g++ -o output_name script_name.cpp
```

### Execution
Run the generated executable:

``` Bash
    ./output_name
```

### Repository Maintenance
.gitignore: Configured to ignore binary .exe files and build artifacts to keep the repository clean.
